# The New Soul Of Science Project Website
A New Approach To Physics, Nature Philosophy, Life, Psychosomatics, Society, And Mathematics – As Website

The New Soul Of Science Project Website is the most visible part of an initiative to find new foundations on several themes in science. Our goals are a new nature philosophy (philosophies) that leads to:

- a new foundation of physics
  - based on dynamic structural regulation processes (Regelprozessen) to create, stabilise, and develop all existences
  - includes a new foundation of life
    - based on a clear definition of consciousness in this setting
  - fulfils the unification of physics
    - including quantum gravity
  - a new foundation of life
    - fully based on regulation processes (Regelprozessen)
    - has a top level regulation process for each individual life (mindfulness process, Achtsamkeitsprozess)
      - clarifies the implications of psychosomatics, the inner relations between our psyche and our body
      - allows deep insights in psychological problems 
      - allows a new definition of our soul and therefore solves the soul-body-problem
    - has even regulation processes to regulate societies
  - extensions of mathematics
    - defining actual endless numbers on an endless prime number product 
    - defining analysis with actual endless numbers 
    - representing negative numbers by sets

# The New Soul Of Science Project Website
**A New Approach To Physics, Nature Philosophy, Life, Psychosomatics, Society, And Mathematics – As Website**

The New Soul Of Science Project Website is the most visible part of an initiative to find new foundations on several themes in science. Our goal is a new nature philosophy (philosophies) and new views on mathematics that leads to:

- a new foundation of physics ([Fractal Quantum Flow Theory](#fractal-quantum-flow-theory))
- a new foundation of life ([Tension Game Of Life](#tension-game-of-life))
- the foundation of [Nature Philosophie Yoga](#nature-philosophie-yoga-naphil-yoga)
- extensions of mathematics ([Superial Numbers](#superial-numbers))
  

## On The Web

## Fractal Quantum Flow Theory

**(fraktale Quanten-Fluss-Theorie)**

On The Web: [Fractal Quantum Flow Theory](http://www.nsosp.org/FrQFT)

- based on dynamic structural regulation processes (Regelprozessen) to create, stabilise, and develop all existences
- includes a new foundation of life
  - based on a clear definition of consciousness in this setting
- fulfils the unification of physics
  - including quantum gravity


## Tension Game Of Life

**(Spannungsspiel des Lebens)**

On The Web: [Tension Game Of Life](http://www.nsosp.org/spannung)

- fully based on regulation processes (Regelprozessen)
- has a top level regulation process for each individual life (mindfulness process, Achtsamkeitsprozess)
  - clarifies the implications of psychosomatics, the inner relations between our psyche and our body
  - allows deep insights in psychological problems 
  - allows a new definition of our soul and therefore solves the soul-body-problem
- allows new perspectives on life science
  - let us see a deep connection between physics and life
  - let us see bridges between modern medicine, modern life science, and alternative medicine and alternative life science
- let us see even regulation processes in the interactions in societies


## Nature Philosophy Yoga (NaPhil-Yoga)

**(Naturphilosophie-Yoga)**

On The Web: [Nature Philosophy Yoga](http://www.NaPhil-Yoga.org)

- based on the insights of the ›Tension Game Of Life‹ and the ›Fractal Quantum Flow Theory‹


## Superial Numbers

**(Superial-Zahlen)**

On The Web: [Superial Numbers](http://www.nsosp.org/de/Superial-Zahlen)

- defining actual endless numbers on an endless prime number product 
- defining analysis with actual endless numbers 
- representing negative numbers by sets

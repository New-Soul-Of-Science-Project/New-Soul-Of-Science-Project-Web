# The New Soul Of Science Project Website
**A New Approach To Physics, Nature Philosophy, Life, Psychosomatics, Society, And Mathematics – As Website**

The New Soul Of Science Project Website is the most visible part of an initiative to find new foundations on several themes in science. Our goals are a new nature philosophy (philosophies) that leads to:

- a new foundation of physics (fractal Quantum Flow Theory, fraktale Quanten-Fluss-Theorie)
  - based on dynamic structural regulation processes (Regelprozessen) to create, stabilise, and develop all existences
  - includes a new foundation of life
    - based on a clear definition of consciousness in this setting
  - fulfils the unification of physics
    - including quantum gravity
- a new foundation of life (Tension Game of Life, Spannungsspiel des Lebens)
  - fully based on regulation processes (Regelprozessen)
  - has a top level regulation process for each individual life (mindfulness process, Achtsamkeitsprozess)
    - clarifies the implications of psychosomatics, the inner relations between our psyche and our body
    - allows deep insights in psychological problems 
    - allows a new definition of our soul and therefore solves the soul-body-problem
  - allows new perspectives on life science
    - let us see a deep connection between physics and life
    - let us see bridges between modern medicine, modern life science, and alternative medicine and alternative life science
  - let us see even regulation processes in the interactions in societies
- the foundation of Nature Philosophie Yoga (NaPhil-Yoga)
  - based on the insights of the ›Tension Game of Life‹ and the ›fractal Quantum Flow Theory‹
- extensions of mathematics (Superial Numbers, Superial-Zahlen)
  - defining actual endless numbers on an endless prime number product 
  - defining analysis with actual endless numbers 
  - representing negative numbers by sets
